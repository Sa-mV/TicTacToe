# TicTacToe

This is a text-based TicTacToe built using c++. The program uses a string to print, store, and update the game layout. The game is ran by 8 helper functions to take input from the user, validate it, update the game status, and then declare the result of each match. Two do-while loops are utilized to allow for repetition.

##### Functions descriptions:

- `print`: Displays the current layout of the game by looping through an array of strings, containing both the 9 slots and the borders (visuals).
- `takeInput`: Takes input from the current player (X or O) while validating the following:
	- The new slot exits (1-9).
	- The new slot is not already occupied.
	- The input is a number.
- `updateLayout`: Changes a slot to X or O based on user input and player's turn.
- `victoryCheck`: Checks for the 8 conditions of victory. The minimum number of turns must have been played before execution. If one of the conditions are valid it calls `victoryUpdate`.
- `victoryUpdate`: Changes the current status of the game (ends it) and assigns a winner.
- `message`: displays the results of the game
- `reset`: resets the layout of the game and other variables to their initial state.

### Learning Outcomes:

This project helped me enforce the following concepts:
- Organize the code by using separate compilation and a function for each task.
- Passing different data types to functions (arrays, pointers, pass by reference vs value).
